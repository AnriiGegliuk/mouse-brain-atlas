Mouse Brain MRI atlas (both in-vivo and ex-vivo)

[![Sample image of ex vivo atlas](https://github.com/dancebean/multi-atlas-segmentation/blob/master/docs/quickcheckdemo.png) "Click for sample quality control image of the parcellation output (generated using mas_quickcheck). The similar color between the olfactory bulb and the cortex is due to the limited colormap of `jet`."](https://github.com/dancebean/multi-atlas-segmentation/blob/master/docs/quickcheckdemo.png)
