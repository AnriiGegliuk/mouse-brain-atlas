Mouse Brain MRI atlas (both in-vivo and ex-vivo)

You can find automatic mouse brain segmentation tools [here](https://github.com/dancebean/multi-atlas-segmentation) which can use the in-vivo/ex-vivo atlas here to perform multi-atlas structural parellation based on non-rigid registration and label fusion.

[![Sample image of ex vivo atlas](https://github.com/dancebean/multi-atlas-segmentation/blob/master/docs/quickcheckdemo.png) "Click for sample quality control image of the parcellation output (generated using mas_quickcheck). The similar color between the olfactory bulb and the cortex is due to the limited colormap of `jet`."](https://github.com/dancebean/multi-atlas-segmentation/blob/master/docs/quickcheckdemo.png)
